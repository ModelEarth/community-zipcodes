# Data Management Workflow

This workflow is designed to manage and maintain data updates in the repository by checking for missing years, populating data, exporting it, and validating the exported files.

## Workflow Triggers

The Data Management Workflow is triggered by two events:
- **Scheduled Runs:** This workflow runs automatically at midnight on the 1st of every month (UTC).
- **Manual Trigger:** The workflow can also be manually triggered using the GitHub UI.

## Workflow Jobs

### 1. Checkout Code
- Uses the `actions/checkout` action to check out the repository code.

### 2. Set Up Python
- Sets up a Python environment using `actions/setup-python`.
- The Python version used is `3.8`.
- **Important Note:** The Python **environment** is set to the **root of the repository**. All paths for the Python files run by the scripts are set relative to the root of the repository.

### 3. Install Dependencies
- Installs required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

### 4. Check for Updates
- Runs the `check_for_updates.py` script located in the `.github/scripts/` folder.
- Outputs the missing years to a file called `gap_years.txt` and sets an environment variable `GAP_YEARS` for further processing.

### 5. End Workflow if No Missing Years
- Checks if there are any missing years detected. If none are found, the workflow ends gracefully.

### 6. Populate Missing Years
- Executes the `populate_data.py` script for each missing year found.

### 7. Export Data
- Runs the `export_data.py` script to export the populated data for each missing year.

### 8. Validate Export
- Validates the exported data by running the `run_validation_test.py` script for each year.
- Outputs results and sets an environment variable `VALIDATION_SUCCESS` to indicate whether all validations passed.

### 9. Commit and Push Changes if Validation Passes
- If all validations succeed, it commits and pushes the changes back to the remote repository.
